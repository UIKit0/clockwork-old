JAVA SOFTWARE RENDERER
======================

Java Software Renderer (JSR) is a 3D software renderer written by
myself to understand the nitty-gritty details of what goes into
rendering 3D objects, from raw data to pixels on a screen.

This is a work in progress so a few bugs may run wild until they get
ironed out, although I assure you that none of them will attempt to find the
answer to life, launch nuclear ABMs or, more realistically, destroy the
content of your hard drive.

Check out the jsr.implementation.pdf document for a detailed
description of the application's features and their implementation, as
well as what and what not to expect from JSR.


RUNNING
-------
This software includes a compiled __jsr.jar__ in the distr folder that can be directly
executed, provided you have a Java Runtime Environment installed on the target computer.
The source code can also be compiled and executed like any other java application.
